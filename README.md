# dota2-macros
Just some macros for some of the harder to use heroes in the game DOTA2.
Will add a proper section on instructions (with pictures) on how to use this set of macros.

The idea of this is basically to make the mechanically harder to play heroes
by automating the simply mechanical part via automation (In this case autohotkey macros. 
Might use lua as well, if I feel the need for it.)
